# Ansible Role: Prestashop 1.7.x

An Ansible Role that installs Prestashop 1.7.x on Debian / Ubuntu.

## Requirements

PrestaShop 1.7.x has the following [system requirements](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/basics/installation/system-requirements/):
* System: Unix, Linux or Windows.
* Web server: Apache Web Server 2.2, Nginx 1.0 or any later version.
* PHP: PHP 7.1 or later ([compatibility chart](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/basics/installation/system-requirements/#php-compatibility-chart)).
* MySQL: 5.6 minimum, a recent version is recommended.

I recommend using the following galaxy roles (and override their default variables to meet Prestashop requirements) :
* `geerlingguy.mysql`
* `geerlingguy.apache`
* `geerlingguy.php`

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

```yml
prestashop_version: 1.7.7.2
```

Prestashop version to deploy.

```yml
prestashop_download_url: "https://download.prestashop.com/download/releases/prestashop_{{ prestashop_version }}.zip"
```

The URL from which to download Prestashop installer.

```yml
prestashop_install_archive: 'prestashop.zip'
```

Prestashop default name for the installation archive.

```yml
prestashop_install_folder: 'install'
```

Prestashop default install folder name.

```yml
prestashop_default_admin_folder: 'admin'
```

Prestashop default admin folder name.

```yml
prestashop_modified_admin_folder: 'admin1'
```

Name of the Prestashop folder which hold the administration backend (for security reasons, it is highly recommended to change this value with a random name, so that directory enumeration is made difficult for a potential attacker).

```yml
prestashop_root_path: "/var/www/prestashop"
```

Prestashop web root (to reference in your local webserver).

```yml
prestashop_user: 'www-data'
prestashop_group: 'www-data'
prestashop_chmod: '0750'
```

Prestashop user, group and chmod (must be the same user and / or group than your webserver system user and group).

```yml

```

To set according to your region.


```yml
prestashop_domain: "prestashop.test"
```

Prestashop domain name (will be written in the database and all `.htaccess` files). If this domain has to change on a working shop, you will have to modify manually the database and `.htaccess` files.

```yml

```

Prestashop database configuration values. Those values are passed to the PHP installation script of Prestashop (more information [here](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS17/Installing+PrestaShop+using+the+command-line+script)):

* `db_clear` : if set to `1`, the installation process will drop existing tables in `prestashop_db_name`.
* `db_create` : if set to `1`, `prestashop_db_name` will be created by the installation process.

```yml
prestashop_name: 'Prestashop'
prestashop_activity: 0
prestashop_country: 'fr'
